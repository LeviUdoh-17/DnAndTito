      "I can’t remember the exact day, but I know I was in SS3 when I met her for the first time. I had been invited to her school to play the talking drum and help DJ their cultural party, something I used to do back then, and I went along with a friend.",
      "I remember seeing her walk out of her class for the first time, and something in me paused. I didn’t speak to her, but deep within me I just knew — this was the right person. I even told my friend that day that she was the one I was going to marry 😂.",
      "Years later, while I was in polytechnic, I had completely forgotten that moment. Life had moved on, and so had I, until one night when I saw her online on Facebook. By then we were both church members, so I casually messaged her to ask why she was awake so late, and that simple question became the beginning of everything.",
      "We started talking, and I told her I was coming back home. Not long after, I asked her to be my best friend, and funnily enough, she requested agbalumo as the condition. I agreed, and we planned to meet at camp since my family had just moved there.",
      "That month, we met at the Holy Ghost Night. I gave her the agbalumo and my sweater because she was cold that night, and from that moment, our friendship truly began. I would visit her house every chance I got, and I slowly realized that I could do anything for her, anytime, any day.",
      "We have seen each other through good times and bad times. We have grown, struggled, laughed, and stayed together through it all, sticking to each other like glue no matter what life threw our way.",
      "By my final year in school, the dynamics of our relationship began to change. We spoke every night, and when I came back home, I could no longer ignore what I felt. The feelings were real, deep, and undeniable.",
      "I didn’t hesitate to tell her that I was going to marry her. At the time, she didn’t quite believe me, but here we are now — about to seal a friendship that started with a drumbeat, an agbalumo, and God’s perfect timing forever."

      "The first time I ever saw him, he was walking down the stairs in what were, at the time, very popular high-top sneakers. In that fleeting moment, I vividly imagined myself standing beside him: me in a wedding gown, him in a suit. The thought felt strange, even irritating, because I had never been the type to fantasize about weddings.",
      "Fast forward to 2016. He asked me to be my best friend, and I agreed, but with one condition: he had to give me agbalumo (because I absolutely love agbalumo). Our first meeting as best friends was during a Holy Ghost Service, and true to his word, he showed up with plenty of agbalumo for me. From that moment, we became inseparable.",
      "He often joked that he would eventually be the one to marry me, but I never took him seriously. To me, he was just my best friend, nothing more. Or so I thought.",
      "Everything began to shift in 2021, while I was in my penultimate year at Badagry. The 2020/2021 period marked a profound turning point in my walk with God. Romantic relationships were completely off the table; my only desire was to serve God wholeheartedly.",
      "But God had other plans. When he walked into my house that August, I was struck by how handsome he looked. I had never seen him that way before, never! 😅 The feeling was unfamiliar, unsettling, and undeniable.",
      "That December, during YMR, I received a clear confirmation in my spirit that he was my husband. When he asked me out, I requested a year to pray. On January 1st, 2023, after crossover, with peace and certainty in my heart, I said yes.",
      "What began as friendship blossomed into love, guided by faith, obedience, and purpose. It has been a beautiful journey, and we are grateful for every step that led us here.",
