      "I remember the day clearly — she walked past, and something in me knew. It wasn't love at first sight in the way movies describe it. It was more like recognition, like seeing someone you've been waiting for without knowing you were waiting.",
      "When I asked her to be my best friend in 2016, I already knew in my heart that this was different. Every Holy Ghost Service, every conversation, every shared agbalumo was a step closer to what I had always believed would happen.",
      "I joked about marrying her because saying it out loud made it feel real. But deep down, it wasn't a joke — it was a promise I was making to myself, to God, and eventually, to her.",
      "2021 changed everything. Our friendship deepened into something I couldn't ignore anymore. Every phone call, every prayer together, every moment of growth — I watched her become more beautiful in ways that had nothing to do with appearance.",
      "When I asked her out, and she requested a year to pray, I respected it completely. That year of waiting only confirmed what I already knew: she was worth every moment of patience.",
      "On January 1st, 2023, when she finally said yes, it felt like the beginning of everything I had ever hoped for. Our story is proof that God's timing is always perfect.",

      "The first time I ever saw him, he was walking down the stairs in what were, at the time, very popular high-top sneakers. In that fleeting moment, I vividly imagined myself standing beside him: me in a wedding gown, him in a suit. The thought felt strange, even irritating, because I had never been the type to fantasize about weddings.",
      "Fast forward to 2016. He asked me to be my best friend, and I agreed, but with one condition: he had to give me agbalumo (because I absolutely love agbalumo). Our first meeting as best friends was during a Holy Ghost Service, and true to his word, he showed up with plenty of agbalumo for me. From that moment, we became inseparable.",
      "He often joked that he would eventually be the one to marry me, but I never took him seriously. To me, he was just my best friend, nothing more. Or so I thought.",
      "Everything began to shift in 2021, while I was in my penultimate year at Badagry. The 2020/2021 period marked a profound turning point in my walk with God. Romantic relationships were completely off the table; my only desire was to serve God wholeheartedly.",
      "But God had other plans. When he walked into my house that August, I was struck by how handsome he looked. I had never seen him that way before, never! 😅 The feeling was unfamiliar, unsettling, and undeniable.",
      "That December, during YMR, I received a clear confirmation in my spirit that he was my husband. When he asked me out, I requested a year to pray. On January 1st, 2023, after crossover, with peace and certainty in my heart, I said yes.",
      "What began as friendship blossomed into love, guided by faith, obedience, and purpose. It has been a beautiful journey, and we are grateful for every step that led us here.",
